# Array's

This is probbably a Data structure everyone is familiar with. You may think that ```const a = []``` is an array but it's not... well what is it? 

### <u>What is an Array?</u>

An array is a contiguious (un-breaking) memory space in which contains a certain amount of bytes. Everything about a computer is just numbers.

There are low-level languages and high-level languages. When using a high-level language like JavaScript or Python, you'll find that it is relatively easy to understand. In other words, a high-level language is closer to natural languages like English. For example, in high-level languages, we don't have to deal directly with machine code or worry about low-level hardware details. We can take many things for granted, such as not having to manually manage the CPU and having built-in data structures. However, it's important to note that high-level languages actually perform a lot of operations behind the scenes. What you write in JavaScript or Python is ultimately compiled into a sequence of 0's and 1's, which is the machine code understood by the hardware.

**Examples of some Low and high level languages**

| Low Level Languages       | High Level Languages     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Machine Code              | JavaScript / TypeScript |
| Assembly                  | Python                   |
| c             | Java                     |
|          c++                  | PHP                      |
