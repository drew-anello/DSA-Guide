# Data Structures and Algorithim's 

I've had my fair share of failures in coding interviews, so I've put together a guide on Data Structures and Algorithms. I hope this resource will help you out and inspire you to dive deeper into this subject! There are plenty of excellent **FREE** courses available on DSA, and one that I've been particularly enjoying is [this one](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/).


# What is Big O

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms' time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement; it will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes. Instead, it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm.

## <u>**Another way to explain it...**</u>

Big O is a way to group or classify your algorithms based on how much time or memory they need as the problem gets bigger. It doesn't tell you the exact number of computer steps it takes, but it helps us understand how the algorithm's performance changes as the problem gets larger."

**or**

As your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?

#### <u>Example (which will make sense soon)</u>

You may hear someone say **"O of N,"** which means your algorithm will grow linearly based on input. 

## <u>**Why do we use it?**</u>

It will help us make decisions about what data structures and algorithms to use. Knowing how they will perform can greatly help create *the best* possible program out there.
